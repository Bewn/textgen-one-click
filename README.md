# textgen-one-click

**work in progress**
will make a release when complete

**this almost works**
some environment issues,
when done simply clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/Bewn/textgen-one-click` then click `./run.sh`
and you will build a portable install of oobabooga that will automatically launch a server and give you a web link that you can use and share with anyone.

I will add a packaged relese with deps installed when ready.


all you have to do is `./run.sh` and all init and install will be done for you in a portable folder

design decision to keep all python deps up to date, so not strictly looking for parity with the standard install.
